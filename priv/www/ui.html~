	<p>Hello, my name is Ghalib Suleiman (or Sulaiman). I like computer
   science, maths, and programming (although since I graduated from
   university, I unfortunately don't get to practise the former two as
   much). Everyone else seems to be putting their code online, so I
   thought I would also hop on the bandwagon. Eventually this will
   become a proper site and you will see various bits of Python,
   Lisp (CL and Elisp), and Erlang (perhaps C++ too). I just bought a
   new laptop, so all that stuff is hidden in the depths of my old
   one, waiting to be rescued.
