Not much of a readme yet (app is still very much in development with
nearly-nonexistent documentation, but it does run after some effort).

For the eager ones, here are the steps to get it running:

1) Install Erlang
2) Install Distel (http://code.google.com/p/distel/)
3) Start erblog on remote server by running start.sh (look into this
file to see/modify startup params passed to erl)
3a) In the erl shell that comes up, run blog_util:init_db(). You onl
need to do this the FIRST time you run the app.
4) Set remote nodename from Distel to your erblog nodename (test that
the connection is successful by hitting C-c C-d g in Emacs)
5) Load the file deps/elisp/blog.el
6) See file doc/examplepost.el for a barebones example (see all def
functions at the bottom of blog.el for complete list)
7) When you are ready to post, do M-x eb-test-html to make sure your
post results in valid HTML, then do an M-x eb-publish-post to publish
your blogpost.  The Elisp abstractions for now are somewhat leaky,
since you do need to know how Mochiweb-HTML works when debugging.

Documentation about how the app works is in the source itself. Basic
dispatch followed by database read (see dispatching in
src/blog_web.erl and trace from there).
