(deftitle "RIP Steve")

(defpara "About a year ago I emailed Steve Jobs asking for Mac OS
X Lion to be distributed on USB sticks so that MacBook Air
owners, lacking a disc drive, could easily install it.  He
replied with a question: 'Why not electronic?'. Why not,
indeed. As usual, Steve's mind was already 10 steps ahead; nine
months later Lion was released electronically through the new Mac App
Store.")

(defpara "I laughed with my friends at how pedestrian I must have sounded. It
was like telling a modern farmer that an ox is better than a horse for
ploughing, only to have him ask 'Why not use a tractor?'.")

(defpara "Steve's philosophy changed who I was for the positive: it affirmed
that there is nothing weird about simultaneously caring for both form and function,
that there is no shame in relentlessly striving for perfection. Most
of all, I learned that I owe it to me to always be true to myself.")

(defpara "Declaring someone a personal hero can sound hyperbolic, but in
this case, I think it is warranted. Steve was one of my heroes.")

(defpara "I'll end with my favourite video on the internet: " (deflink "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc" "Steve's 2005
Stanford commencement address") ".")

(defpara "RIP Steve. I still have my original 5GB iPod.")
