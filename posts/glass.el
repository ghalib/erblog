disagree, I think it's worth asking yourself: why aren't Segways and
Bluetooth earpieces more popular?")

pulling out one's smartphone. By all accounts it does this rather well
given its impressive technology.")

(defpara "But I don't think it is the right product for normal people, for the
simple reason that people look too dorky wearing it. This may
make it better suited for niche environments where people aren't judged on
their looks (e.g. certain occupations that would benefit from a
heads-up display).")

(defpara "I would be more convinced of mass market appeal if the product
morphed such that it could be embedded into, say, sunglasses, without
being noticeable (putting aside the question of whether society would
ever accept a tech product that is both intrusive and invisible). But
until then, its current form factor on people's faces is too much of
an eyesore.")

(defpara "One can point to all the early tech-enthusiast adopters
of Glass as evidence of future success. It wouldn't be the first
time tech people were enthusiastic about a product that quickly
went mainstream (Macs running OS X were very much an early
tech-crowd adoption). But tech-nerd enthusiasm isn't always
a sufficient condition for future success; see 'Linux on the

alleviate the inconvenience of having to constantly pull out their
smartphones? My bet is on smartwatches.")
