     (defpara
       "I can't find a better way to describe this textbook other
than to say that it has been written with the utmost love. From
the layout and the binding to the prose and exercises, the level
of care that has gone into it is remarkable.")
     (defpara "For what it is (an introductory undergrad book), some
of the exercises can be quite challenging. But while reading it
you can't help but feel that Spivak himself is there with you all
the way, guiding you through things while knowing when to step
back and let you figure it out for yourself (and if you find
yourself truly stuck, he has generously created a comprehensive
" (deflink "http://www.amazon.com/dp/0914098926" "solutions manual") ").")
     (defpara "Far from aiming to only be a routine tutorial to
calculus, the author's intention was for the book to also be a
student's first introduction to higher mathematics. To that end,
I think the closest analogy to it from the programming world
is " (deflink "http://www.amazon.com/dp/0070004846" "SICP") ", so
it may be fair to call this the 'SICP of mathematics' (except
that it is grander, given that mathematics is a grander
subject).")
     (defpara "My undergrad calculus textbook
was " (deflink "http://www.amazon.com/dp/0495011606" "Stewart") " (look
at that eye-watering price). I know that it's an extremely
popular choice but in contrast to Spivak I found it drab and
dull, due to not doing much in the way of explaining the
motivations or deep insights behind the introductions of various
concepts."))

 (li (header 'h4 (deflink "http://www.amazon.com/dp/0387982582" "Linear
 Algebra Done Right") " by Axler")
 (defpara "This book is clearly written by an opinionated
person. The opinion in this case being that determinants are just
not that important. And so, their introduction is left for right
at the end of the book, after Jordan form.")
 (defpara "It also eshews messy computation for what the
author deems to be a cleaner exposition. Vector spaces and
linear maps are introduced right at the beginning, and the rest
of the book revolves around interesting definitions and proofs
that follow from that. There is minimal talk of computation with
matrices, thus it is in heavy contrast to a typical undergrad
linear algebra class, where one dives into matrices and their
computations rather arbitrarily.")
 (defpara "All this is to say, this is certainly a book for
the pure math majors (the author himself recommends it for a
second course for such creatures). Do not read it if you want a
quick real-world application (there are other books for that);
instead do so for a deeper insight into the pretty abstractions
underlying the subject."))

 (li (header 'h4 (deflink "http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201558025/" "Concrete
 Mathematics") " by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik")

     (defpara "I've never come across a serious mathematics textbook
that at the same time has been written with such a sense of
fun. This is immediately apparent when you crack it open - there
are liner notes all throughout from students of the course
this book was born from (one from the intro says \"I don't see
how what I've learned will ever help me\").")

     (defpara "What makes this book serious is of course the
subject matter. Its aim is to introduce all the mathematics
necessary for analysing algorithms (it would be good preparation
for tackling the exercises in
Knuth's " (deflink "http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321751043" "AoCP") "). The
'concrete' in the title comes from the fact that it covers both
continuous and discrete mathematics (though mostly discrete).")

     (defpara "Having said that, the mathematics itself is
clearly also treated with a fun spirit - concepts that you had
previously assumed to be simple and superficial are probed deeply
to reveal all sorts of mathematical 'sleight of hand' methods and
manipulations. For example, chapter 3 is wholly devoted to the
floor and ceiling functions. I did not know there was so much to
say about these - when I was first taught them it was a simple
definition and that was it; we all moved on rather quickly.")

of the other end an absolute ninja at algebraically manipulating
mathematical formulae.")

     (defpara "The font of this book, AMS Euler, deserves
special mention (for which this book was a debut). To
quote the book, the purpose of this font is 'to capture the
flavor of mathematics as it might be written by a mathematician
with excellent handwriting'. Seeing it on printed paper, I find
the font very attractive indeed.")))

(defpara "For now, the blunt truth is that I prioritise building things over
working through these books. But there is a sincere (albeit perhaps unrealistic) wish to someday make time for them.")
