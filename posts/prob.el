(deftitle "Probability Book Recommendation")

(defpara "I hope to resume blogging soon, but for now I wanted to
briefly note that for those wanting to learn probability, I
heartily
recommend " (deflink "http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~mark/degroot/" "DeGroot
and Schervish") ".")

(defpara "I sat in on a class that
used " (deflink "http://www.amazon.com/dp/013603313X/" "Ross") ", but (modulo
the latter statistics half of M&S that Ross does not cover) I
found the language in M&S to be more crisp and concise. I also
found the key points easier to find and extract, whereas the treatment in Ross felt cluttered.")

(defpara "Ross is chock-full of interesting exercises though.")
