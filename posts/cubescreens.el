(deftitle "Display on the Inside of Cubicle Walls")

(defpara "For most technical jobs where the employees reside
in cubicles, the sight of coworkers gathering in someone's cube
to look at their screen is a common occurrence. But said screen
is usually running at high-resolution, optimised for viewing by
one person: the one sitting in front of it.")

(defpara "I wonder how practical it would be to somehow have a
mirror display/projection on the inside of the cubicle wall,
right at the entrance. This display would be switched on/off
on-demand. Thus when people stop by the cubicle for a discussion,
they can comfortably remain standing at the entrance and
look/point at the mirror projection on the cubicle wall, instead
of awkwardly bending and stretching their necks forward to get a
closer look at the cubicle resident's screen")
