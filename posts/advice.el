(deftitle "Does Advice Have to be Useless?")

(defpara "There is a large canon of expected mistakes from
newbies in all areas: the first-time parent who panics when their
baby cries; the freshly-graduated doctor who rushes through his
first medical assessment; the newly-promoted manager who doesn't
communicate with his employees; the newlywed who doesn't
understand the concept of compromise; the list goes on. Simple
mistakes that yield effective lessons for the future.")

(defpara "All these people are commonly told \"Expect to screw up
on your first time\". Yet the activities these first-timers
undertake are not ones no one has performed before. In fact,
countless individuals have done so - what we refer to as
'experience'.")

(defpara "Given the large body of past experience and its
associated advice, why are newbies still expected to screw up?
One can conclude that no one really expects said advice to be
useful until _after_ the newbie has made the mistake.")

(defpara "But does it have to be like this? Is there no way to learn and
internalise common lessons and patterns without making mistakes? This
way when the newbie is faced with a common pattern for the first time,
the response becomes a simple case of applying the correct
internalised lesson?")

(defpara "A friend offered an idea akin to cognitive behavioural
therapy: memorise whatever set of lessons you are intent on
internalising, then test your recall every few months. The idea
being that you eventually internalise them so deeply (akin to

even if you have not experienced them before. This sounds
plausible, but neither of us has put it to the test.")
